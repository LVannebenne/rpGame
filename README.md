# CLI Roleplay Game

This project is to create a CLI game about a "Book where you are the Hero".

## Installation

While the base story isn't finished, the project is avaible on github but not on NPMJS. 

So, to give a try to the package :
- Clone this repo
- You need *NodeJs* (with npm) 
- And *nodemon* package 
(you'll find more instructions further in the page)

You can find instructions to install NodeJs on this repo [NodeJS on Ubuntu / Debian](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions-enterprise-linux-fedora-and-snap-packages)

I use version 12 of Node.Js, i can't guarantee retrocompatibility with olders versions. To know about your version:
```
node -v
```
To install nodemon globally: 
```
npm i -g nodemon 
```

## Usage

To lauch the game : 
1. Open the terminal in the repo directory
2. Lauch nodemon in the terminal
```
nodemon . 
```
3. Follow the instructions and Play (and maybe have fun...) ! 

You can type exit to get out of the script.
```
exit
```

With nodemon, you can type 'rs' to restart the scripts.
```
rs
```

Remember that the story is not finished yet... Sorry for the inconvenience.


## About

Because i'm more interested about the core system rather than the story itself, i have coded the core to be modulary and story must be "switchable". In the future, i'd like to create a database of stories. And propose stories to play at the begin of the program.

## Contribute

I will be very happy if some people with good writing skills or plenty of imagination want to contribute to create story, or have great ideas to improve the system. Don't hesitate to contact me or create pull request.
